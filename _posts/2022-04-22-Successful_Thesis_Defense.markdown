Today I finally defended my dissertation entitled: 
<blockquote> 
Unraveling the Phenomenon of Blockchain InnovationFive Studies on Blockchainâ€™s Role for Economic and Sustainable Development
  </p></blockquote> 
and I am extremly excited!
It was very challenging to present five years of research in only 30 minutes, but I really enjoyed the discussion that lasted approximately 90 minutes following the presentation. I was thrilled that so many of my colleagues and family who showed up to watch and celebrate with me afterwards, it certainly made me more nervous though :smile:. 
After the presentation and discussion, the reviewers discussed the final grade (the presentation and the actual thesis are graded separately) and after only five minutes, the result of magna cum laude was proclaimed.

I am very grateful for the guidance and support of my thesis committee:  Professors [Nir Kshetri, University of North Carolina](https://bryan.uncg.edu/faculty-and-staff/kshetri-nir-b/), [Timm Teubner, Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/tds/ueber-uns/team/prof-dr-timm-teubner), and [Knut Blind, Technical University of Berlin/Fraunhofer ISI](https://www.tu.berlin/inno/ueber-uns/leitung). Special thanks to Knut for the persistent professional and emotional support in the previous years.

The goal of the circular economy is to transition from today's linear economic model to a **closed-loop economy** based on resource regeneration and ecosystem restoration. Hence, instead of the linear paradigm (i.e.,*take, make, dispose*) that focuses on continuous growth, the circular economy postulates a closed loop within the planet's ecological limits based on three main principles: *reduce, reuse, and recycle*. Research has shown that **innovation can be crucial in transitioning to a circular economy**.

## How can blockchain technology support the transition?
We identified **five categories** through which blockchain-based innovations could support the transition to a circular economy based on interviews with 18 experts and data triangulation with peer-reviewed literature. First, Blockchain-based **supply chain management systems** can facilitate traceability in complex supply chains and increase responsible buying behavior by providing trusted provenance knowledge (e.g., the origin of harvested timber in an immutable record). Second, in **waste management**, blockchain can support waste exchange platforms and recycling schemes through smart contracts. Third, blockchain can support the use of **renewable energies** through peer-to-peer energy trading platforms and source verification systems. Although many blockchain applications (e.g., Bitcoin) still rely on energy-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus with potentially negative environmental consequences, the technology is increasingly maturing and further transitioning to more sustainable consensus mechanisms (e.g., proof-of-stake). Fourth, blockchain-based **token rewards systems** incentivize sustainable behavior (e.g., the Plastic Bank and waste collection schemes). And lastly, blockchain could **disintermediate the sharing economy** and significantly decrease transaction costs with peer-to-peer smart contracts for sharing assets.

## Our findings
In addition to identifying and clustering blockchain-based innovations, we developed a theoretical model of relationships between blockchain-based innovations and drivers and barriers of the Circular Economy. The model is based on empirical data (and not conceptual or anecdotal as previous research did) and should support future research in the domain to understand the relationships. Our main finding is that blockchain can be the proper technological infrastructure for many circular economy applications, whereas it cannot be a panacea for solving all inherent challenges of transitioning to a Circular Economy (e.g., the trade-off between sustainability and profit objectives or lack of governmental support). In some cases, blockchain-based innovations can moderate drivers (i.e., increase) and barriers (i.e., decrease) of the transition to a circular economy. However, a significant challenge that spans across many blockchain applications is the so-called **Oracle problem**: oracles (in reference to the ancient Greek gods) are the **trusted gateway between a blockchain and the physical world**. These oracles process external and deterministic data and convert it to a format to be stored as an immutable record on the blockchain. It becomes clear that (as in any other translation of analog to digital data) the transmission of the data requires trust in the gateway. A solution for this is increasing the automation of processes and the technological convergence with **Internet of Things** technologies (e.g., sensors and RFID chips) to reduce the risk of inaccurate data entry. At the same time, additional external data sources (e.g., GPS) can be harnessed to triangulate data entries.

This is our theoretical model of relationships:
