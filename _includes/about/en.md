Hi, I am Moritz Böhmecke-Schwafert, husband, dad and economist. I am a research associate at the Technical Institute of Berlin (TU Berlin) currently pursuing a PhD at the Chair of Innovation Economics on the interplay and role of digital innovation and institutions for economic development in emerging countries.
I am passionate about the potentials of digital technologies such as Blockchain to address institutional weakness and allow leapfrogging or upgrading in Global Value Chais in countries of the Global South.
Apart from this, I am a senior consultant at IBM Germany where I am engaging in the digital transformation of the German Health and Insurance sector. 

At the TU Berlin I am regularly holding the lecture "Digital Innovation" and different seminars. I love to work together with our students and embrace new teaching methods to induce their critical thinking and creativity.

I obtained a Masters degree in Economics with a focus on Innovation Economics from the University of Jena (Germany) with some time abroad at the University of Jyväskylä (Finland) and the Universidad de la Frontera (Chile). Besides, I have a Bachelor in Business and Economics and studied Roman Language and philology for a few semesters.
