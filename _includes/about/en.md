Hi, I'm Moritz, in a nutshell I'm economist, digital innovation consultant, enthusiastic marathon runner and first and foremost dad of two amazing kids. I work as a managing consultant for AI and data platforms at IBM with the mission to digizite and transform the European health system. Currently, I'm the lead product owner of the EU digital vaccination certificate and CovPass Apps. Furthermore, I'm a lecturer and postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Berlin, affiliated with the Chair of Innovation Economics from Professor Knut Blind. I obtained my Master's degree in Economics with a focus on Innovation Economics from the University of Jena (Germany) with some amazing time abroad at the University of Jyväskylä (Finland) and the Universidad de la Frontera (Chile). Besides, I hold a Bachelor in Business and Economics and studied Roman Language and philology for a few semesters. 

My PhD thesis analyzed the phenomenon of blockchain innovations and five studies investigats the technology's role for economic and sustainable development on different levels. I defended my thesis in April 2022 with a fantastic doctoral committee, featuring Professors Knut Blind, Nir Kshetri, and Timm Teubner.

My research is driven by the passion to unravel the potentials of digital technologies such as blockchain for solving crucial development issues and their contribution to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I am particularly interested in digital innovation's capabilities to internalize institutional weaknesses and opening avenues for countries for the Global South to leapfrog and upgrade in Global Value Chains. Moreover, I am curious about different regulatory approaches to the digital economy (e.g., GDPR and AI, or regulatory sandboxes for blockchain-based innovations).  Having spent five years as a research associate at the Chair of Innovation economy, a great part of my hearth lies in academia. In the last years, I got all the support necessary from my supervisor Professor Knut Blind to build up my own curriculum for a master-level lecture called Digital Innovation with innovative teaching methods that I facilitate since 2018. 

I'm passionate about university teaching, science communication, and academic discourse, working together with our students and embrace new teaching methods to induce their critical thinking and creativity. My mission is to communicate the sense of wonder about scientific discoveries and arguments, informing, educating, and raising awareness of science-related topics in my research area. Therefore, I am glad to have the opportunity to have a regular teaching platform, holding lectures (e.g., at TU Berlin), facilitate seminars and workshops (e.g., at WU Vienna), and supervise Master theses. While teaching students at the university level, I aim to perpetuate knowledge and inspire learning. More specifically and thematically, I thrive on introducing students to the analysis of the role of technological change for sustainable development and encourage them to critically reflect on the consequence of this transformation on an economic, environmental and social level.
