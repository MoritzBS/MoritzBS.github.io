Hi, I'm Moritz Böhmecke-Schwafert, dad, marathon runner, and economist. Currently I am a managing consultant for AI and data platforms at IBM and a lecturer for digital innovation and researcher at the Technical University of Berlin. I obtained a Master's degree in Economics with a focus on Innovation Economics from the University of Jena (Germany) with some time abroad at the University of Jyväskylä (Finland) and the Universidad de la Frontera (Chile). Besides, I have a Bachelor in Business and Economics and studied Roman Language and philology for a few semesters. 

I have submitted my Ph.D. in Economics at the TU Berlin (Doctoral committee: Professors Knut Blind, Nir Kshetri, Timm Teubner) and I am looking forward to defend it in April 2022. My thesis unravels the phenomenon of blockchain innovations and five studies investigats the technology's role for economic and sustainable development on different levels. I am very happy about having spent the last five years as a research associate at the Chair of Innovation Economics where I got all the support possible from my supervisor Professor Knut Blind to build up the curriculum of my own master-level lecture called Digital Innovation
I am passionate about the potentials of digital technologies such as blockchain to contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), internalizing institutional weaknesses and opening avenues for the Global South to leapfrog and upgrade in Global Value Chains. Moreover, I am curious about different regulatory approaches to the economy and digital technologies (e.g., GDPR and AI, or regulatory sandboxes for blockchain-based innovations.

I love university teaching, science communication, and academic discourse, working together with our students and embrace new teaching methods to induce their critical thinking and creativity. Moreover, I’m passionate about communicating the sense of wonder about scientific discoveries and arguments, informing, educating, and raising awareness of science-related topics in my research area. Therefore, I am glad to have the opportunity to hold the lecture "Digital Innovation" every summer semester at the TU Berlin, facilitate seminars and workshops (e.g., at WU Vienna), and supervise Master theses.
