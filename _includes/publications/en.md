Abstract. Information and Communication Technologies such as blockchain can significantly contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Global South (GS). Grounded in the innovation forecasting literature, this paper explores blockchain-based innovations and research in the context of economic and sustainable development to answer the following research questions: what is the status quo of blockchain innovations and research in the Global South?; and further, how can blockchain innovations contribute to economic and sustainable development? We follow a mixed-method approach based on web mining and topic modeling with unstructured empirical data on blockchain innovators from Crunchbase, their websites, and academic publications to address these research questions. Our results indicate that blockchain innovators already engage in various application areas beyond the financial sector, addressing critical development issues. However, the empirical data on blockchain research and innovations suggests a largely untapped potential in various promising application areas relevant for the SDGs, such as sustainable energy or integrity verification. The major contributions of this paper are an overview and status quo of entrepreneurial innovation activities and research on blockchain technology in the GS, an analysis of these areas in the context of the SDGs, and a lean methodological approach for innovation forecasting.

economy through an empirical investigation. Business Strategy and the Environment, 1– 16. https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.3032**

Abstract: Blockchain is increasingly lauded as an enabler of the transition to a circular economy. While there is considerable conceptual research and some empirical studies on this phenomenon, scholars have yet to develop a theoretical model of blockchain's role in this transition. Grounded in the sustainability transition literature, this paper addresses this gap through the following research question: What role does blockchain play in the transition to a circular economy? Following an abductive approach, we conducted interviews with ground-level experts implementing blockchain innovations for the circular economy across Europe and the United States. Through a thematic analysis, we derived a theoretical model of the relationships among (1) drivers and barriers of the transition to a circular economy, (2) blockchain innovation for the circular economy, (3) technical challenges of blockchain, and (4) the circular economy. While blockchain plays a moderating role, interviewees considered it only an infrastructural resource rather than a panacea.

Abstract: Blockchain technology has the potential to bring transparency and trust to a multitude of use cases. Our research demonstrates that the technology can reduce asymmetric information in markets by bridging trust gaps. The combination of blockchain and Internet of Things technology that automatically collects sensor data, provides a feasible, decentralized technological solution for such an inefficient “Market of Lemons” coined by nobel laureate Georg Akerlof. In this paper, we develop a system prototype to reduce mileage fraud on the used car markets. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of a trusted system of records for (vehicle) data such as mileage data using a distributed database based on the public Ethereum network and smart contracts. We have identified eight requirements that are fulfilled by the prototype and the functional logic and design of thesolution can be reproduced to any other application area characterized by a lack of trust between actors or by the absence of a trusted central authority. However, the developed prototype suffers from similar limitations and challenges as the technology itself. Low throughput causes limitations in scalability and transaction costs are unpredictable. Further development of the blockchain technology and considering more cost-efficient consensus mechanisms will address these issues.

Abstract: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has recently come into force and will have wide implications for the digital economy and the business models of various tech firms, as well as providing new opportunities for innovation. The GDPR aims to provide consumers with the control of their personal data, provide trust in the digital economy and harmonize data protection throughout the EU pursuant to the Digital Single Market strategy. This paper attempts to analyze and outline how the GDPR might change the data-driven business models (DDBMs) of firms, yet nonetheless they may lead to a variety of positive effects. Indeed, the principles and individual rights in the GDPR tackle monopolistic structures (and lock-ins), and they can increase the quality of data and digital provisions as a result of competitive pressures, as well as promoting consumer trust in the digital market. One of the individual rights and newer features introduced by the GDPR, namely the right to ‘data portability’, will be considered with regard to the case of its impact on Facebook’s DDBM.
